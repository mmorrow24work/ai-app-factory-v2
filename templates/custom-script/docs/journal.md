# Build Journal

Per-issue record of the unattended (Lane B) build of this project. One entry per Claude run,
appended automatically by `.github/workflows/claude.yml` via `.github/scripts/journal-entry.sh`.

## How this file is written

**Entries are appended by the workflow, not by Claude inside its PR.** This is deliberate:
having Claude append a journal entry within each PR means every open PR touches the same file,
so almost every one goes `CONFLICTING` the moment any other PR merges — leaving green,
auto-merge-enabled PRs sitting unmerged indefinitely. Patching from the workflow after the run
sidesteps that entirely: Claude's branches never touch `docs/journal.md`.

## What "Estimated Cost" means

This pipeline authenticates via a **Claude subscription** (OAuth), not pay-per-token API
billing. The cost figure is notional — what the run *would* cost at standard list rates —
useful as a consistent yardstick for comparing runs, not an actual charge.
