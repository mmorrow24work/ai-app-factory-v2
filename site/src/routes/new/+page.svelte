	 * Builds a pre-filled "New issue" link rather than calling any authenticated API -- no
	 * GitHub token of any kind is needed to submit an ask. draft-design-doc.yml triggers on
	 * `issues: opened`, filtered to the `[new-project-ask] ` title prefix, and reads the
	 * issue's title/body directly; the issue's author becomes the requester's identity,
	 * authenticated by GitHub's own login rather than typed into a form field.
	 *
	 * The title prefix carries the trigger, not the `labels` param below -- GitHub silently
	 * drops `labels=` on this URL for anyone who isn't already a collaborator with label-write
	 * access on the target repo. The predecessor (`ai-app-factory`) found this via a real
	 * end-to-end test that only "worked" because it happened to be run by the repo owner, who
	 * has that permission and structurally couldn't have caught the failure -- see DESIGN.md's
	 * "Lessons carried forward". `title`/`body` have no such restriction. `labels` is kept here
	 * only as a harmless best-effort convenience for collaborators -- the workflow applies the
	 * label itself server-side regardless, for bookkeeping only.
	 *
	 * Requirements text is deliberately NOT put in this URL -- GitHub enforces a hard URL
	 * length limit ("Whoa there! Your request URL is too long") that anything beyond a short
	 * paragraph blows straight through, found live in the predecessor with a real multi-section
	 * spec (DESIGN.md's "Lessons carried forward"). The body here is a short, constant
	 * placeholder instead; the real text goes to the clipboard in `submit()` for the visitor to
	 * paste over it on GitHub's own page, which has no such limit.
	 *
	 * @returns {string}
