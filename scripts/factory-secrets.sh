# factory-secrets.sh — set the CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN and GH_PAT Actions
# secrets a factory-new.sh-created repo needs before its claude-go pipeline
# can run.
#
# The two secrets are handled differently on purpose:
#
#   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN comes from the local .env store and is safely
#   reusable across every project -- it's a Claude subscription credential,
#   not a GitHub one, so a leak costs quota, not repo access.
#
#   GH_PAT is never read from .env and never persisted anywhere. This repo's
#   own DESIGN.md ("GH_PAT: token strategy") records why: a single
#   .env-stored GH_PAT value copied into every project's own secret means a
#   leak from any ONE generated repo exposes a token that can act on ALL of
#   them -- tried and rejected in the predecessor, twice. Prompted
#   interactively (input hidden) every run instead, so it's minted fresh,
#   scoped to just this one already-existing repo, and lives only in this
#   process's memory for as long as it takes to hand it to `gh secret set`.
#
# See scripts/README.md for the expected shape of the .env store.

Usage: factory-secrets.sh <repo-name> [options]

Sets CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (from a local .env file) and GH_PAT (prompted
fresh, never stored) as GitHub Actions secrets on the target repo.

Arguments:
  <repo-name>       Name of the repository (no owner prefix)

Options:
  --owner NAME       GitHub owner/org the repo belongs to (default: the
                      currently authenticated 'gh' user, via
                      'gh api user --jq .login')
  --env-file PATH    Path to the .env file to read CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from
                      (default: $DEFAULT_ENV_FILE)
  -h, --help         Show this help

GH_PAT is read from the GH_PAT environment variable if already exported in
this shell (e.g. for scripting: 'GH_PAT=... factory-secrets.sh my-tool'),
otherwise prompted for interactively with input hidden -- mint a fresh
fine-grained PAT scoped to "Only select repositories: <repo-name>" (the repo
must already exist -- run factory-new.sh first) with Contents, Issues, Pull
requests, Actions, Secrets (Read and write). Never paste it on a bare command
line -- it'll land in shell history in plaintext.

  factory-secrets.sh my-new-tool
